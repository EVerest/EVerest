# EVerest with docker

You can build docker images of everest-core or out-of-tree repositories using the provided utility script.

## Build an EVerest docker image

With

```bash
./build.sh [--conf <string>]
```

a docker image of everest-core will be created using the given EVerest configuration file.

**It is important to note that if you require ssh access, the ssh agent forwarding should be done without sudo privileges.
By running the script in sudo this changes the user and causes issues with the ssh forwarding.**
It is possible to make your user not require sudo privileges when running docker, this should be done instead.

Specify the following options to create your desired docker image of EVerest:

* repo: Git repository (e.g. https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core.git) - Optional, defaults to: https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core.git
* branch: Git branch or tag name (e.g main or 2024.6.0) - Optional, defaults to: main
* conf: Path to EVerest config file (e.g. /home/$(whoami)/checkout/everest-workspace/everest-core/config/ config-sil.yaml) - Required.
* ocpp-conf: Path to EVerest OCPP config file (e.g. /home/$(whoami)/checkout/everest-workspace/libocpp/aux/config-docker.json) - Optional, defaults to: ocpp-config.json
* name: Name of the docker image (e.g everest-core) - Optional, defaults to: everest-core
* build-date: Build date of the docker image, is reflected in its name and can have an effect on caching - Optional, defaults to the current datetime

```bash
./build.sh [--repo <GIT-REPOSITORY>] [--branch <BRANCH-NAME>] [--conf <EVEREST-CONFIG>] [--ocpp-conf <OCPP-CONFIG>] [--name <IMAGE-NAME>] [--build-date 2042]
```
Remember to provide an ocpp configuration file if you use an EVerest config that loads the OCPP module. Be aware that the provided OCPP config file will always be named `ocpp-config.json` inside the docker container. Consider this when configuring the OCPP module within the EVerest config and to set the ChargePointConfigPath accordingly.

Images will be created in a .tar.gz format in this folder.

## Run EVerest in docker

To run the image in a docker container, run the following commands

```bash
docker load < <YOUR_IMAGE-TIMESTAMP.tar.gz>
docker run --rm -it --network host <IMAGE_NAME>
```

## Run EVerest with OCPP 2.0.1 in docker
To run EVerest with OCPP 2.0.1 you can use the provided docker-compose.yaml with the example run-config-fallback.sh script
