Dependency Manager for EVerest
##############################

Install and Quick Start
***********************

To install the **edm** dependency manager for EVerest you have to perform the following steps.

Please make sure you are running a sufficiently recent version of **Python3 (>=3.6)** and that you are able to install Python packages from source. Usually you just have to ensure that you have **pip**, **setuptools** and **wheel** available. Refer to the `Python Installing Packages <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#requirements-for-installing-packages>`_ documentation for indepth guidance if any problems arise.

.. code-block:: bash

	python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

Installing edm
**************

Now you can clone this repository and install **edm**: 
(make sure you have `set up your ssh key in github <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-ssh>`_ first!)

A script for the steps below can be found `here <https://github.com/EVerest/everest-utils/tree/main/everest-cpp>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone git@github.com:EVerest/everest-dev-environment.git
	cd everest-dev-environment/dependency_manager
	python3 -m pip install .
	edm --register-cmake-module --config ../everest-complete.yaml --workspace ~/checkout/everest-workspace

The last command registers the :ref:`EDM CMake module <cmake_integration_setup>` and creates a workspace in the *~/checkout/everest-workspace* directory from a `config that is shipped with this repository <https://github.com/EVerest/everest-dev-environment/blob/main/everest-complete.yaml>`_. The workspace will have the following structure containing all current dependencies for everest:

.. code-block:: bash

	everest-workspace/
	├── everest-core
	├── everest-deploy-devkit
	├── everest-dev-environment
	├── everest-framework
	├── everest-utils
	├── liblog
	├── libmodbus
	├── libocpp
	├── libsunspec
	├── libtimer
	├── open-plc-utils
	├── RISE-V2G
	└── workspace-config.yamleverest-core

The workspace-config.yaml contains a copy of the config that was used to create this workspace.

Enabling CPM_SOURCE_CACHE
*************************
The **edm** dependency manager uses `CPM <https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake>`_ 
for its CMake integration. This means you *can* and **should** set the 
*CPM_SOURCE_CACHE* environment variable. This makes sure that dependencies 
that you do not manage in the workspace are not re-downloaded multiple times. 
For detailed information and other useful environment variables please 
refer to the `CPM Documentation <https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/blob/master/README.md#CPM_SOURCE_CACHE>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

	export CPM_SOURCE_CACHE=$HOME/.cache/CPM

Building everest
****************
Make sure you have installed `ev_cli <doc_tutorial_EV-CLI.html>`_ first.
You can now use the following commands to build everest-core:

.. code-block:: bash

	cd ~/checkout/everest-workspace/everest-core
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make install

Python packages needed to run edm
*********************************
The following Python3 packages are needed to run the **edm** dependency manager. If you installed edm using the guide above they were already installed automatically.

+ Python >= 3.6
+ Jinja2 >= 3.0
+ PyYAML >= 5.4

.. _cmake_integration_setup:

Setting up CMake integration
############################
To use the EDM CMake module you must register it in the CMake package registry. You can use the following command to achieve this:

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --register-cmake-module

This will create a file at ~/.cmake/packages/EDM/edm that points to the directory in which the EDM CMake module has been installed. You probably have to do this only once after the initial installation, but be advised that this might have to be done again if you reinstall edm with a different version of Python.

Setting up a workspace
######################
A sample workspace config, everest-complete.yaml, for the EVerest project is provided in the root directory of this repository. You can set up this workspace with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --register-cmake-module --config ../everest-complete.yaml --workspace ~/checkout/everest-workspace

Updating a workspace
####################
To update a workspace you can edit the workspace-config.yaml file in the root of the workspace. You can then use the following command to apply these changes.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --workspace ~/checkout/everest-workspace --update

If you are currently in the everest-workspace directory the following command has the same effect.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --update

Be advised that even if you remove a repository from the config file it WILL NOT be deleted from the workspace.

An attempt will be made to switch branches to the ones specified in the config, however this will be aborted if the repository is dirty.

Repositories also WILL NOT be pulled, you should check the state of your repositories afterwards with the commands described in :ref:`Git information at a glance <git_information_at_a_glance>`

Using the EDM CMake module and dependencies.yaml
################################################

To use edm from CMake you have to add the following line to the top-level CMakeLists.txt file in the respective source repository:

.. code-block:: bash

	find_package(EDM REQUIRED)

The EDM CMake module will be discovered automatically if you registered the CMake module in the way it described in the Setting up CMake integration section of this readme.

To define dependencies you can now add a dependencies.yaml file to your source repository. It should look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

	---
	liblog:
	  git: git@github.com:EVerest/liblog.git
	  git_tag: main
	  options: ["BUILD_EXAMPLES OFF"]
	libtimer:
	  git: git@github.com:EVerest/libtimer.git
	  git_tag: main
	  options: ["BUILD_EXAMPLES OFF"]

If you want to automatically check out certain dependencies into a workspace you can add a **workspace.yaml** file to the root of your source repository. It should look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

	---
	workspace: ~/workspace
	local_dependencies:
	  liblog:
	  libtimer:

You can overwrite the git_tag in your workspace.yaml, so you can use a development version in your workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

	---
	workspace: ~/workspace
	local_dependencies:
	  liblog:
	    git_tag: devel
	  timer	:

Create a workspace config from an existing directory tree
#########################################################
Suppose you already have a directory tree that you want to save into a config file. You can do this with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --create-config custom-config.yaml

This is a short form of

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --create-config custom-config.yaml --include-remotes git@github.com:EVerest/*

and only includes repositories from the EVerest namespace. You can add as many remotes to this list as you want.

For example if you only want to include certain repositories you can use the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --create-config custom-config.yaml --include-remotes git@github.com:EVerest/everest* git@github.com:EVerest/liblog.git

If you want to include all repositories, including external dependencies, in the config you can use the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --create-config custom-config.yaml --external-in-config

.. _git_information_at_a_glance:

Git information at a glance
###########################
You can get a list of all git repositories in the current directory and their state using the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --git-info --git-fetch

If you want to know the state of all repositories in a workspace you can use the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

	edm --workspace ~/checkout/everest-workspace --git-info --git-fetch

This creates output that is similar to the following example.

.. code-block:: bash

	[edm]: Git info for "~/checkout/everest-workspace":
	[edm]: Using git-fetch to update remote information. This might take a few seconds.
	[edm]: "everest-dev-environment" @ branch: main [remote: origin/main] [behind 6] [clean]
	[edm]: "everest-framework" @ branch: main [remote: origin/main] [dirty]
	[edm]: "everest-deploy-devkit" @ branch: main [remote: origin/main] [clean]
	[edm]: "libtimer" @ branch: main [remote: origin/main] [dirty]
	[edm]: 2/4 repositories are dirty.
