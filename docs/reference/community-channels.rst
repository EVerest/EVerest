Meet the EVerest Community
##########################

EVerest is an open source software and has also a very open community around
it.

"Open community" means that you can join discussions, thought exchanges and
prioritization meetings without dedicated registration or allowance.

See below for all the communication channels that can be joined by you right
now.

Dive in, read the thoughts of others, ask your questions and get involved!

Zulip chat
==========

On the Zulip instance of Linux Foundation Energy, there are chat channels for
EVerest.

This is for thought exchange, for questions and talks about dedicated work on
EVerest topics. Feel free to to drop your own questions and dive into
communication with other EVerest enthusiasts.

We have created working groups (see below) to focus on
special topics in EVerest and get the development communication structured.
You will see those working groups as streams in Zulip.

So, the best place to be near development thought exchange is Zulip.

You can find us here: https://lfenergy.zulipchat.com/

Another way to connect to the steadily growing EVerest community is the mailing
list.

We have set up two separate mailing lists:

1. The most important one is the announcement list. Important news or events
   all around EVerest are shared there. Subscribe here: |link_announcementlist|.
2. Optionally, you can subscribe to the detailed mailing list with all
   developer's exchange: |link_mailinglist|.

If you do not want to ask your questions in the Zulip chat, you can use the
detailed mailinglist to get your questions answered.

Weekly tech meetup and working groups
=====================================

Since the beginning of 2024 we organize our community and development
exchange in the format of working groups.
The formerly called **weekly tech meetup** is now one of those working
groups. Now, we simply call it "General Working Group".

Those are all EVerest working groups:

- General (for general topics and to get a common ground for updates from the
  other working groups)
- Car Communication (car/charger communication with topics ISO 15118, EXI,
  SLAC, CHAdeMO etc)
- Cloud Communication (communication between charger and backends in cloud
  with topics OCPP 1.6, 2.0.1, 2.1 etc)
- EVerest Framework and Tools (framework topics and tools like edm, ev-cli
  etc)
- Testing and CI

You might wanna join us in the general working group to meet the community
without having focused on a special area of EVerest (yet).

For the General Working Group, meet us here each Tuesday at 4pm in CE(S)T
time-zone:

https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/92086494169?password=b2df6774-bc19-46f9-8c71-bbd13a0266a1

To see links to the meetings of all other working groups, see the publicly
available LFE EVerest calendar:

https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/everest

Additionally, you might want to join the working group chat channels in Zulip.
See the "Zulip chat" section above to see how to get there!

Special Interest Group "EV Charging"
====================================

Linux Foundation Energy (LFE) is growing. As the EVerest project (and all
other LFE projects) have several connecting points to other projects in the
same field, a Special Interest Group (SIG) has been created for

* exchanging thoughts and experiences,
* share best practices,
* discuss industry trends and
* tackle challenges together.

If you work in the field of EV charging and you are interested in open source
software / projects, join the SIG calls. They are free to access and open to
all interested parties.

Join the mailing list: https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/ev-charging-sig

1:1 meetup
==========

If you do not find your way into the EVerest community, let's try to help you.
Just book a meeting via the link below. Of course, this is optionally. You
are allowed to join the Zulip sessions and also take part in the working group
meetings without registration.

.. hint::
    In this 1:1 meetup, we will not talk about technical topics. We will rather
    see where you should start in the community if you have problems entering
    the meetups or the discussions.

Just book a 30-minute meetup here:
