***************
What Is EVerest
***************
EVerest is an open source modular framework for setting up a full stack
environment for EV charging.

The modular software architecture fosters customizability and lets you
configure your dedicated charging scenarios based on interchangeable modules.
All this is glued together by MQTT.

EVerest will help to speed the adoption to e-mobility by utilizing all the open
source advantages for the EV charging world. It will also enable new features
for local energy management, PV-integration and many more.

The EVerest project was initiated by `PIONIX GmbH <https://pionix.com>`_
(`Pionix at LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/company/pionix-gmbh>`_) to help with the electrification of the mobility sector and is an official project of the Linux Foundation Energy.

    </a>

The easiest and fastest way to connect to the steadily growing EVerest
community is the mailing list.

We have set up two separate mailing lists:

1. A detailed mailing list with all developer's exchange. Subscribe here: |link_mailinglist|.
2. An announcement list where important news or events get shared. Subscribe here: |link_announcementlist|.

Recommendation is to subscribe at least to the announcement list and optionally - if you
want to get the real detailed talk - also subscribe to the general list.

In the general list, you can get your questions answered and you can read into the
thoughts and development use cases of your community colleagues.

The announcment list will give you summaries of EVerest achievements and info about
our public meetups to which you are invited to join.

Zulip chat
----------

On the Zulip instance of Linux Foundation Energy, there are chat channels for
EVerest.

This is for more direct exchange and for dedicated work on EVerest topics. We
have created working groups (see below) to focus on special topics in EVerest.

So, the best place to be near to where the development thought exchange
happens, Zulip is the place to go.

You can find us here: https://lfenergy.zulipchat.com/

Weekly tech meetup and working groups
-------------------------------------

Since the beginning of 2024 we organize our community and development
exchange in the format of working groups.
The formerly called **weekly tech meetup** is now one of those working
groups. Now, we simply call it "General Working Group".

Those are all EVerest working groups:

- General (for general topics and to get a common ground for updates from the
  other working groups)
- Car Communication (car/charger communication with topics ISO 15118, EXI,
  SLAC, CHAdeMO etc)
- Cloud Communication (communication between charger and backends in cloud
  with topics OCPP 1.6, 2.0.1, 2.1 etc)
- EVerest Framework and Tools (framework topics and tools like edm, ev-cli
  etc)
- Testing and CI

You might wanna join us in the general working group to meet the community
without having focused on a special area of EVerest (yet).

For the General Working Group, meet us here each Tuesday at 4pm in CE(S)T
time-zone:

https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/92086494169?password=b2df6774-bc19-46f9-8c71-bbd13a0266a1

To see links to the meetings of all other working groups, see the
LFE EVerest calendar (user account required):

https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/everest/calendar

Additionally, you might want to join the working group chat channels in Zulip.
See the "Zulip chat" section above to see how to get there!

1:1 meetup
----------

If you do not want to start talking about your requirements and projects in
a big round, we can also give you the possibility to talk in a 1-on-1 meetup
with a community guide.

Just book a 30-minute meetup here:
https://calendly.com/manuel-ziegler-pionix/30min

.. hint::
    In this meetup, we will try to understand your dedicated requirements and
    see where in the EVerest ecosystem you can contribute or get support. If
    there is a need for technically deeper exchange, we can plan to set your
    topic on the agenda of the weekly tech meetup.

We prepared a path to get step by step into the EVerest world. It will lead you
from a high level overview right into understanding how to implement modules
for your dedicated hardware scenarios or developer use cases.

To walk this path, simply read on and follow the table of contents below.
