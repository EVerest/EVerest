What Is EVerest
***************
EVerest is an open source modular framework for setting up a full stack environment for EV charging.

The modular software architecture fosters customizability and lets you configure your dedicated charging scenarios based on interchangeable modules. All this is glued together by MQTT.

EVerest will help to speed the adoption to e-mobility by utilizing all the open source advantages for the EV charging world. It will also enable new features for local energy management, PV-integration and many more.

The EVerest project was initiated by PIONIX GmbH to help with the electrification of the mobility sector and is an official project of the Linux Foundation Energy.

Find Your Way Into EVerest
**************************
We prepared a path to get step by step into the EVerest world. It will lead you from a high level overview right into understanding how to implement modules for your dedicated hardware scenarios or developer use cases.

To walk this path, simple go on reading and follow the table of contents below.

Besides that, you might want to reach out and stay in touch with us via the following channels:

* `EVerest mailing list <https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/everest>`_: You will get your questions answered and will also get regular information about our public meetups to which you are invited to join. A tech meetup for all contributors is currently held once a week.
* `YouTube-Channel <https://www.youtube.com/@lfe_everest>`_: Stay up-to-date with webinars and get insights from the Technical Steering Committee recordings.
* Don't forget to follow us on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/everestincharge>`_ or `Mastodon <https://fosstodon.org/@EVerest>`_

But now let's dive in the EVerest journey to get you on board. Start on top level with the first chapter and walk the path down to your first module implementation.
