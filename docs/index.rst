***************
What Is EVerest
***************
EVerest is an open source modular framework for setting up a full stack
environment for EV charging.

The modular software architecture fosters customizability and lets you
configure your dedicated charging scenarios based on interchangeable modules.
All this is glued together by MQTT.

EVerest will help to speed the adoption to e-mobility by utilizing all the open
source advantages for the EV charging world. It will also enable new features
for local energy management, PV-integration and many more.

The EVerest project was initiated by `PIONIX GmbH <https://pionix.com>`_
(`Pionix at LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/company/pionix-gmbh>`_) to help
with the electrification of the mobility sector and is an official project of
the Linux Foundation Energy.

If you are into LinkedIn, make sure to follow the EVerest project there:

Testing and setting up EVerest
==============================

You are currently on the main documentation page of EVerest.
This is the right place to learn about understanding how things work together
and how to test EVerest.

Just read on through all the sections and you will find a
:ref:`Quick Start Guide <quickstartguide_main>`, more detailed explanations
about the EVerest modules concept and tutorials.

Contributing to EVerest
=======================

EVerest is an open source software and has also a very open community around
it.

"Open community" means that you can join discussions, thought exchanges and
prioritization meetings without dedicated registration or allowance.
See below for all the communication channels that can be joined by you right
now.

To learn about **contributing to the source code** of EVerest, read our
`contribution file in the main EVerest repository <https://github.com/EVerest/EVerest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
.

If you rather want to contribute to the documentation, you should have a look
at the :ref:`Documenting EVerest page <documenting_everest>`.

There are quite a few other resources that you might want to check out:

Communication channels
======================

.. _index_zulip:

Zulip chat
----------

The most important place for thought exchange, questions and discussions is
the Zulip chat of the Linux Foundation Energy.

You can find chat channels there for different topics all around EVerest.

Feel free to drop your own questions and dive into the communication with other
EVerest enthusiasts.

Read the README channel in Zulip for more information about the different
channels.

You can find us here: https://lfenergy.zulipchat.com/

Mailing list

    <a href="https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/everest" target="_blank">
        <img src="_static/icons/mail.svg" style="height: 0.8em;"> <b>EVerest mailing list</b>

    </a>

Another way to connect to the steadily growing EVerest community is the mailing
list.
As Zulip is the main place for all the information and news around EVerest,
the mailing list is an optional way if you prefer contacting the core team via
email.

We have set up two separate mailing lists:

1. The most important one is the announcement list. Important news or events
   all around EVerest are shared there. Subscribe here: |link_announcementlist|.
2. Optionally, you can subscribe to the detailed mailing list with all
   developer's exchange: |link_mailinglist|.


Weekly tech meetup and working groups
-------------------------------------

We also have online video meetings for a more personal way of exchange.

The General EVerest Welcome Call is a format since the beginning of 2025.
If this compass page at hand leaves some questions open and you want to clarify
that in person, you can join us in a weekly (non-technical) meeting.
We can answer question all around the EVerest community and show you the way
to go with your specific scenario.

The General EVerest Welcome Call is each Tuesday at 11am CE(S)T.

For joining us in the Zoom meetings, find the links in the
`official EVerest event calendar <https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/everest?view=week>`_.

Further live meetings we regularly have are the working group meetings.
In the working groups, developers meetup for exchanging the status quo of
dedicated projects and topics.

The working groups are to change over time depending on the current needs of
the community. Currently, we have the following working groups:

- Car Communication (car/charger communication with topics ISO 15118, EXI,
  SLAC, CHAdeMO etc)
- Cloud Communication (communication between charger and backends in cloud
  with topics OCPP 1.6, 2.0.1, 2.1 etc)
- Energy Management
- MCS (Megawatt Charging System)

The links to the Zoom meetings of the working groups can also be found in the
`official EVerest event calendar <https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/everest?view=week>`_.

If you work on a topic that does not fit in the current list of working groups,
you can ask in Zulip or in the General Call for finding like-minded people and
suggest creating a new working group.

You might want to join the working group chat channels in Zulip.
See the "Zulip chat" section above to see how to get there!

Special Interest Group "EV Charging"
------------------------------------

Linux Foundation Energy (LFE) is growing. As the EVerest project (and all
other LFE projects) have several connecting points to other projects in the
same field, a Special Interest Group (SIG) has been created for

* exchanging thoughts and experiences,
* share best practices,
* discuss industry trends and
* tackle challenges together.

If you work in the field of EV charging and you are interested in open source
software / projects, join the SIG calls. They are free to access and open to
all interested parties.

Join the mailing list: https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/ev-charging-sig

We prepared a path to get step by step into the EVerest world. It will lead you
from a high level overview right into understanding how to implement modules
for your dedicated hardware scenarios or developer use cases.

To walk this path, simply read on and follow the table of contents below.
