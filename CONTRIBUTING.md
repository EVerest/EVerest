# Contributing to EVerest

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EVerest.
If you just need help or have a question, refer to [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).

This document explains our contribution process and procedures.

The EVerest community has various member roles: Contributor is everyone who submits content to the project, Committers review and approve such submissions, and the Technical Steering Committee provides general project oversight.
The [governance policy] is the reference document for it and has more details.

All contributors must comply with the project's [Technical Charter].

## Weekly tech sync meeting

Every week, there's an online meeting open for everyone. Just come by and say hello ðŸ™‚.

See the [EVerest calendar](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/everest/calendar) for the dates.
There you can also subscribe to this calendar.

## How to Contribute a Bug Fix or Change

Each contribution must meet the [Java Script](.eslintrc.json) or [C++](.clang-format) _coding style_ (part of every repository) and include:

- Tests and documentation to explain the functionality.
- Any new files have [copyright and license headers]
- A [Developer Certificate of Origin signoff].
- Submitted to the project as a pull request.

Each commit message and pull request description should have enough information
in it so that other contributors can understand what has been changed and
eventually which impact the change will have.

EVerest is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.md) license. Contributions should abide by that standard license.

Project committers will review the contribution in a timely manner, and advise of any changes needed to merge the request.
