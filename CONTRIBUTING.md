# Contributing to EVerest

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EVerest. This document explains
our contribution process and how to contribute a bug fix or change.

For a description of the roles and responsibilities of the various members of
the EVerest community, see the [governance policies], and for further details,
see the project's [Technical Charter]. Briefly, Contributors are anyone who
submits content to the project, Committers review and approve such
submissions, and the Technical Steering Committee provides general project
oversight.

If you just need help or have a question, refer to
[COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md).

To contribute code to the project, first read over the [governance policies]
page to understand the roles involved.

Each code contribution must include:

* Tests and documentation to explain the functionality.
* Any new files have [copyright and license headers]
* A [Developer Certificate of Origin signoff].
* Submitted to the project as a pull request.

Each commit message and pull request description should have enough information
in it so that other contributors can understand what has been changed and
eventually which impact the change will have. Issue and pull request templates
of the repositories of the EVerest organization support a proper format
of code contributions.

Every pull request for a feature request must link an issue. Pull request for
bugfixes do not necessarily need to link an issue, but they should contain a
proper description of the bug that is fixed.

You can use draft pull requests if you want to share your current state
and start a discussion about your changes. As soon as a draft pull request
is converted to be ready for review, the CODEOWNERS will be automatically
notified and start the review process.

If reviewers require changes to your PR, please keep the commit history clean
and do not rebase and force push to your branch, so that the changes can be
tracked and reviewers can quickly identify if the required changes have been
addressed.

Each contribution must meet the [Java Script](.eslintrc.json) or
[C++](.clang-format) *coding style* (part of every repository).

EVerest is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.md) license.
Contributions should abide by that standard license.

Project committers will review the contribution in a timely manner, and advise
of any changes needed to merge the request.
